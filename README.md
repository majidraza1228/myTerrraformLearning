. Cloud-native Platforms: Cloud-native technologies, such as containers, microservices, and serverless computing, are already gaining significant popularity. In 2024, cloud-native platforms are expected to become even more prevalent as organizations continue to migrate their applications and infrastructure to the cloud and adopt cloud-native development practices.

2. Low-Code/No-Code Platforms: Low-code and no-code platforms enable users to build applications with minimal coding or development experience. These platforms abstract away the complexities of traditional software development, allowing faster application development and deployment. In 2024, we can expect the adoption of low-code/no-code platforms to increase, empowering non-technical users to create custom applications and reducing the burden on development teams.

3. DataOps: DataOps is an emerging practice that focuses on streamlining and automating the processes involved in data analytics and data management. It aims to improve collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and other stakeholders involved in data-driven decision-making. In 2024, DataOps is likely to gain momentum as organizations recognize the importance of efficient data management and analytics.

4. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): PaaS provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. PaaS offerings are continuously evolving to provide greater flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. In 2024, PaaS is expected to become more mature and feature-rich, enabling developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

5. Automation and AI/ML in Platform Engineering: Automation has been a key focus in platform engineering, and this trend will continue in 2024. Organizations will increasingly leverage AI/ML technologies to automate various aspects of platform engineering, including infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and incident response. These technologies will help improve platform reliability, performance, and efficiency.

6. Platform Security and Compliance: With increasing cybersecurity threats and stringent regulatory requirements, platform security and compliance will remain a top concern for organizations. In 2024, platform engineering practices will incorporate robust security measures, including automated security testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance monitoring, to ensure the integrity and protection of platforms and applications.
